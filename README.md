This is for using CNNs as a model to study the receptive fileds of the retinal cells.

First, one can use RGCModelwithSubunits.m to simulate a RGC with stimuli to get spikes.

Then one can run the CNN model to find subunits as in the paper, and predict the neural response of single RGCs, as shown inthe paper.
